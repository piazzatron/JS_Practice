Mix in Backbone.Events into any object with _.extend
	then you can call event methods on the object:
		.on (used for binding a callback to an event)
			convention is colons to namespace your events 'e.g. poll:start'
			takes an optional third parameter, context for the callback
			events:
				"all"
		.off (remove the binding)
		.trigger (event, [*args]
		.listenTo (listens to a particular event on another object)
			context is always the object

Render methods return a reference to the view for chaining purposes
